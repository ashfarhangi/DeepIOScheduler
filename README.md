# DeepIOScheduler
A Deep Learning Strategy for I/O Scheduling in Storage Systems
## Overview 
This project is aimed at enhancing the performance of storage systems in the big data era through deep learning. By leveraging a deep recurrent neural network, this project predicts I/O requests to pre-load memory contents, thus preventing cache/memory misses and improving overall system efficiency.

## Features
• **Predictive I/O Scheduling:** Utilizes deep recurrent neural networks to learn and predict I/O request patterns.
• **Improved Cache/Memory Performance:** Pre-loads predicted I/O requests to reduce cache/memory misses.
• **Time-Aware Multi-Task Prediction:** Addresses timing constraints to ensure predictions are made and acted upon in a timely manner.
